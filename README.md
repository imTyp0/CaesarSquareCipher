Python and C implementations of Caesar's square cipher

# What is Caesar's square cipher (aka box cipher)?
Caesar Box is a transposition cipher used in the Roman Empire, in which letters of the message are written in rows in a square 
and then read by column.

# Example with the string "abcdefghi":

// write it to a square  
a b c  
d e f  
g h i  

// then read it by column  
a d g b e h c f i

That's it. Quite the simple cipher really.
